# what's this?

This project contains my all Rust solutions about leetcode's problems.

# some file's structure and coding style are weird?

Yes, they are. It's not a type of performance art.

It's because that I'm a noob about Rust when I start this project.

So, It's not only leetcode's solutions but also my Rust training.

If you are also interested about Rust and leetcode, this project can maybe give u some inspiration.

# disclaimer

The test data of leetcode is updating every day.

So I canâ€™t guarantee that all the code will pass the validation.
