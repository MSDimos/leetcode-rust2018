# what's this?

This project contains my all Rust solutions about leetcode's problems.

# some file's structure and coding style are weird?

Yes, they are. It's not a type of performance art.
  
It's because that I was a noob about Rust when I started this project.

So, It's not only leetcode's solutions but also my Rust training.

If you are also interested in Rust and leetcode, this project maybe give u some inspiration.

# disclaimer

The test data of leetcode is updating every day.

So I canâ€™t guarantee that all the code will pass the validation.

And Rust is updating every day too, so I can't guarantee that all codes can work well in ur version of Rust either.
